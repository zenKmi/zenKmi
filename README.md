## Hey there!

I'm Zen, or **zenKmi** as I usually go online.

I'm an Information Systems Engineer since 2024, and currently work as a Full Stack and AI Dev. I've been learning plenty of things since then, and I'm excited to learn so much more.

About me:
- My favorite things are: videogames, music, and all kind of tech stuff.
- I love learning languages, both programming and spoken. I'm fluent in English and Spanish... so "Hola!".
- I can code in C#, Java, JS, TS, but I also know some Go, Python, and Lua.
- I'm always open to contributing in some open-source projects. I love learning and I'll definitely go wherever I can get more knowledge.
